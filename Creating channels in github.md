6. Create the channel by clicking on the "Create" button.

7. Repeat steps 1 to 4 to create the second channel.

8. For the second channel, use the naming convention "jopfsj77-internal". This channel will serve as an internal channel for admin members only.

9. Once both channels are created, the "jopfsj77" channel will have both candidates and admin members, while the "jopfsj77-internal" channel will only have admin members.
