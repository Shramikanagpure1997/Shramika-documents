-  The first Tele-calling team contacts the individuals for the campaign and confirms their interest and availability by discussing the batch timings.
    
-   They create a WhatsApp group and add all the interested candidates to facilitate communication.
    
-   One day before the event, they send the Slack invitation to the participants.  
    
-   To gather the email IDs of the finalized interested candidates, they copy all the addresses from the campaign sheet at once.
    
-   On Slack, they locate the option to invite people to code by clicking on the arrow in the top section.
