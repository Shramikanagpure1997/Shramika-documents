# Handling daily online session
1.  Posting Zoom Meeting Link: You post the Zoom meeting link 15 minutes prior to the session in the Slack channel. This allows participants to access the link and join the meeting.
    
2.  Starting Zoom Session: The Zoom session begins 5 minutes prior to the scheduled start time of the trainer's session. This gives everyone a few minutes to join and get settled before the actual session begins.
    
3.  Waiting for Participants: Once the Zoom session has started, you wait for 5 minutes to allow all participants to join. This ensures that everyone has enough time to connect to the meeting and resolve any technical issues.
    
4.  Making the Trainer Co-Host: Once the trainer joins the session, you make them a co-host. This gives the trainer additional control and privileges within the Zoom meeting, such as managing participants, sharing their screen, and conducting activities.
    
5.  Starting the Session: Once the trainer is present and set up as a co-host, you begin the session. This is the official start of the training or teaching portion of the meeting.
    
6.  Taking Attendance: After the session starts, you proceed to take attendance. This is usually done to keep track of who attended the session for various purposes, such as reporting, evaluation, or certification.
    
7.  Submitting Session Notes: After the session concludes, you ask job seekers or participants to submit their session notes in a deliverable form. This could be a specific document, form, or platform where participants can share their notes or summaries from the session.
